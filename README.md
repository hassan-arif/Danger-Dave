Danger Dave is a 1988's computer game developed by John Romero.
Emulator for Assembly (iAPX88 architecture):- DOSBox.

"main.asm" file contains entire implementation.
Instead of screenshots, I've attached a video i.e., "walkthrough.mp4" which covers the entire game.

The entire game is easy to operate by anyone.
Instructions are also available on the main screen of the game, have fun!

Created in December, 2021.
